Here are some talks which have given me new insight into programming, and in
particular what good programming is and isn't.

#### [Mike Acton: Data-orientated Design](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rX0ItVEVjHc&t=1306s) 

Setting the record straight on three big lies: 

- Software is the platform
- Code should be designed around a model of the world
- Code is more important than data

#### [Jonathan Blow: How to program independent games](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjDsP5n2kSM&t=2169s)

One of the most important metrics to optimize for is hours of your life spent
programming something. You have a finite amount of hours in your life after all,
which you'd surely like to spend on other things too.

#### [Eksil Steenberg: How I program in C](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=443UNeGrFoM&t=21s)

> In the beginning all you want is results, in the end, all you want is control

#### [Rich Hickey: Hammock Driven Development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc)

Your most powerful problem solver is your subconscious mind.

#### [Rich Hickey: Simple Made Easy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rI8tNMsozo0)

Simple is not the same as easy. Don't confuse them.

#### [Brian Will: Why OOP is Bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QM1iUe6IofM)

Almost everything that's interesting in a non-trivial program are
'cross-cutting' concerns. When faced with the reality of real word programs,
promises of encapsulation tend to be broken, and object graphs quickly become
tangled webs.

#### [Abner Coimbre: What Programming is Never About](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzc3HcIgXis)

The emphasis of programming should be on solving problems, and not on the code itself.

#### [Scott Meyers - CPU Caches and Why You Care](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDIkqP4JbkE&t=3842s)

Iterating over a two dimensional array by row is much faster than by column.

#### [Jeff and Casey Show: The Evils of Non-native Programming](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK50z_gUpZI)

We always hear arguments for Garbage Collection, and Virtual Machines, but what about the counter arguments?

#### [Jeff and Casey's Guide to Becoming a Bigger Programmer](https://mollyrocket.com/jacs/jacs_0004_0016.html)

A strong emphasis on being a critical thinker, and making sure that the code practices that you adopt actually benefit you.

#### [Hadi Hariri: The Silver Bullet Syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3wyd6J3yjcs)

A depressing tour of the software industry, and it's quest for the silver bullet.
