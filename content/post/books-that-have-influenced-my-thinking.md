Here's a list of books that I've found particularly thought provoking. Each of
them has a wealth of insight, wisdom, and knowledge to share. Many of them are
worth reading a few times.

I was going to sum up what each of them meant to me in a paragraph or two, but I
quickly realized that it would no longer be a paragraph or two then. Instead I
have included a quote from each book that I really liked.

### Antifragile

![Antifragile cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/antifragile.jpg)

> Few understand that procrastination is our natural defense, letting things take
> care of themselves and exercise their antifragility; it results from some
> ecological or naturalistic wisdom, and is not always bad -- at an existential
> level, it is my body rebelling against its entrapment. It is my soul fighting
> the Procrustean bed of modernity.

### Don't Sleep, There Are Snakes

![Don't sleep there are snakes cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/dont-sleep-there-are-snakes.jpg)

> They have no craving for truth as a transcendental reality. Indeed, the concept
> has no place in their values. Truth to the Pirahãs is catching a fish, rowing a
> canoe, laughing with your children, loving your brother, dying of malaria. Does
> this make them more primitive? Many anthropologists have suggested so, which is
> why they are so concerned about finding out the Pirahãs notions about God, the
> world, and creation.
>
> But there is an interesting alternative to think about things. Perhaps it is
> their presence of these concerns that makes a culture more primitive, and their
> absense that renders a culture more sophisticated. If that is true, the Pirahãs
> are a very sophisticated people. Does this sound far-fetched? Let's ask
> ourselves if it is more sophisticated to look at the universe with worry,
> concern, and a believe that we can understand it all, or to enjoy life as it
> comes, recognizing the likely futility of looking for truth or God?
>
> -- <cite> Daniel L. Everett </cite>

### Talent is Overrated
![Talent is overrated cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/talent-is-overrated.jpg)

> Landing on your butt twenty thousand times is where great performance comes from.

### Excellent Sheep

![Excellent Sheep cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/excellent-sheep.jpg)

> The system manufactures students who are smart and talented and driven, yes, but
> also anxious, timid, and lost, with little intellectual curiosity and a stunted
> sense of purpose: trapped in a bubble of privilege, heading meekly in the same
> direction, great at what they’re doing but with no idea why they’re doing it.
>
> -- <cite> William Deresiewicz </cite>

### Weapons of Mass Instruction

![Weapons of Mass Instruction cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/weapons-of-mass-instruction.jpg)

> School trains children to be employees and consumers; teach your own to be
> leaders and adventurers. School trains children to obey reflexively; teach your
> own to think critically and independently. Well-schooled kids have a low
> threshold for boredom; help your own to develop an inner life so that they’ll
> never be bored. 
>
> -- <cite> John Gatto Taylor </cite>

### Outliers

![Outliers cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/outliers.jpg)

> The lesson here is very simple. But it is striking how often it is overlooked.
> We are so caught in the myths of the best and the brightest and the self-made
> that we think outliers spring naturally from the earth. We look at the young
> Bill Gates and marvel that our world allowed that thirteen-year-old to become a
> fabulously successful entrepreneur. But that's the wrong lesson. Our world only
> allowed one thirteen-year-old unlimited access to a time sharing terminal
> in 1968. If a million teenagers had been given the same opportunity, how many
> more Microsofts would we have today? 
>

### Blink

### The Wayfinders

![The Wayfinders cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/the-wayfinders.jpg)

> If diversity is a source of wonder, its opposite - the ubiquitous condensation
> to some blandly amorphous and singulary generic modern culture that takes for
> granted an impoverished environment - is a source of dismay. There is, indeed,
> a fire burning over the earth, taking with it plants and animals, cultures,
> languages, ancient skills and visionary wisdom. Quelling this flame, and
> re-inventing the poetry of diversity is perhaps the most importent challenge
> of our times.

### Cave in the Snow

![Cave in the Snow cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/cave-in-the-snow.jpg)

> Normally we are so identified with our thoughts and emotions, that we are them.
> We are the happiness, we are the anger, we are the fear. We have to learn to
> step back and know our thoughts and emotions are just thoughts and emotions.
> They're just mental states.
>
> -- <cite> Vicki Mackenzie </cite>

### Bones of the Master

![Bones of the Master](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/bones-of-the-master.jpg)

> To a spiritual skeptic like myself, Tsung Tsai was too good to be true, a
> Renaissance man: monk, poet, philosopher, house builder, scientist, doctor,
> and when necessary, kung fu asskicker. It would spoil everything if he began
> proselytizing. I was constantly on the look-out for him to begin trying to
> convert me to devotion and practice. But he never did.

> -- <cite> George Crane </cite>

### Thinking in systems: A Primer

![Thinking in Systems cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/thinking-in-systems.jpg)

> People who cling to paradigms (which means just about all of us) take one look
> at the spacious possibility that everything they think is guaranteed to be
> nonsense and pedal rapidly in the opposite direction. Surely there is no power,
> no control, no understanding, not even a reason for being, much less acting, in
> the notion or experience that there is no certainty in any worldview. But, in
> fact, everyone who has managed to entertain that idea, for a moment or for a
> lifetime, has found it to be the basis for radical empowerment. If no paradigm
> is right, you can choose whatever one will help to achieve your purpose. It is
> in this space of mastery over paradigms that people throw off addictions, live
> in constant joy, bring down empires, get locked up or burned at the stake or
> crucified or shot, and have impacts that last for millennia. In the end, it
> seems that mastery has less to do with pushing leverage points than it does with
> strategically, profoundly, madly letting go.
>
> -- <cite> Donna Meadows </cite>

### An Introduction to General Systems Thinking

### Deep Work

![Deep Work cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/deep-work.jpg)

> To remain valuable in our economy, therefore, you must master the art of quickly
> learning complicated things. This task requires deep work. If you don’t
> cultivate this ability, you’re likely to fall behind as technology advances.
> 
> -- <cite> Cal Newport </cite>

### Thinking Fast and Slow

![Thinking Fast and Slow cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/thinking-fast-and-slow.jpg)

> Odd as it may seem, I am my remembering self, and the experiencing self, who
> does my living, is like a stranger to me.
>
> -- <cite> Daniel Kahneman </cite>

### Radical Honesty

![Radical Honesty cover](/images/post/books-that-have-influenced-my-thinking/radical-honesty.jpg)

> Bullshit is a sales pitch for an interpretation of reality that comes with any
> interpretation of reality. All interpretations of reality are bullshit. Freedom
> is not being dominated by your own bullshit.
>
> -- <cite> Brad Blanton </cite>
