Let's face it, we live in an authoritarian society. We are taught from a young
age to obey orders, and to trust information from places of authority - almost
without question. This tends to stay with us throughout our lives, in one form
or another. It takes guts and courage to swim upstream, to actively go against
industry 'best practices' and instead choose methods you think are better.
People might laugh at you, or call you crazy. But don't forget - without people
like you there wouldn't be progress.

I've watched numerous interviews with programmers that I consider good at their
craft and there is one common trait they all tend to have - **they trust
themselves**. Faced with the question of when they would use a certain
programming practice or tool, their reply is usually something along the lines
of "It depends". They use a healthy dose of common sense, reasoning and
experimentation to weigh up the tradeoffs and they aren't afraid to stop using
something if it no longer brings any benefits - no matter what some authority says.

Good programmers tend to have vastly different styles and approaches. There's no
single way to approach programming well. All roads lead to Rome. What's more
important is finding what works for you, and you can only do that by learning to
trust your own judgment.
