I dislike writing about myself, because I feel it's impossible to really
summarize any human being into a few paragraphs, but I'll try give you a tiny
glimpse of who I am.

I'd describe myself as a student of both life and myself, on a journey along the
road least traveled. In the words of Mark Twain, I think the majority is almost
always wrong, and the minority is sometimes right. As a result, I tend to have
unorthodox views on just about everything. Not because it makes me different,
but rather because that's just who I am. I try my best to always be true to
myself, and go with what I think makes practical sense, rather than what some
authority figure thinks I should be doing.

I'm an autodidact who
loves [reading](http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27235915-oliver-powell) and
learning new things. I've
recently
[taught myself hand-balancing](https://www.instagram.com/oliverpowell84/) after
being inspired by the movement community. I continue to expand my physical
movement ability. My long-term goal is
the [one-arm handstand](https://www.instagram.com/p/BLPfcY7l10f/?taken-by=yuri_marmerstein&hl=en). The only
reason you have a brain, [is because you needed to move](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s0CpRfyYp8).

I think meditation is the key to truly understanding myself, and that having
less things makes me happier.

I have a strong interest in health and wellness, which I believe is holistic.
I'm a big fan of Ray Peat's [work](http://raypeat.com/) in this area.

I'm a fan of both nature and technology, and believe that it's possible to
combine them in ways where everyone wins. I'm
a [systems thinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_thinking), and
generalist at heart, who happens to write software for a living. I feel lucky to
have programming in my toolbox, and I think it needs to become a more widespread
skill.

In my opinion, virtually all formal education institutions, including the elite
universities, have forgotten the origin of the word educate, namely to 'draw
out'. In general, these institutions are more focused on filling empty vessels,
rather than drawing out of full ones. Worthless grading systems, become more
important
than
[fostering curiosity](https://www.ted.com/talks/shimon_schocken_the_self_organizing_computer_course),
and
[creativity](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity).
Such institutions are better at
producing
[excellent sheep](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18775383-excellent-sheep)
rather than true free thinkers. There are of
course [exceptions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZQe73IXZtU).

I dream of
a [post-scarcity economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-scarcity_economy),
where human potential can be freed up, and where people can spend their days
creating things they love, and sharing them with the world, without worrying
about how they are going to pay rent, or eat.

Recently I have been following the ideas of
the [handmade](http://static.chronal.net/hmh/manifesto.html) software community,
and enjoying the paradigm shift.
